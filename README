This project is focused on performing an "in situ" refactoring of the
boto library.  By that I mean a refactoring on top of the existing
boto library.  By pulling in bits and pieces of boto within a newly
designed and refactored set of interfaces, we can hopefully:

 * Leverage the stability of the boto library
 * Maintain backwards-compatibility with existing boto users
   and applications.
 * Explore and benefit from a new design that makes it easier
   to expand boto to support new services.

Roboto starts with a different set of logical, hierarchical objects.

 * Provider (e.g. Amazon Web Services)
   * Service (e.g. Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2))
     * Endpoint (e.g. us-west-1 AKA region)
       * Host (e.g. ec2.us-west-1.amazonaws.com)
       * Port (e.g. 443)
       * Path (e.g. /)
     * Request (e.g. DescribeInstances)
     * Response (e.g. XML data returned by DescribeInstances)

Almost all of the information about these objects is specified
declaratively using JSON.  These JSON descriptions are read in
at run time and define everything from which URL to talk to to
the exact format of a request and it's response.

Installation
------------
Eventually, this will be packaged up properly but for now follow
these instructions to try out the current version of roboto:

 # Download the current source tarball by clicking on the Downloads
   button on the github.com project page

 # Un-tar the tarball in your desired location

 # Adjust your PYTHONPATH environment variable accordingly, e.g.:
 
   $ export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/roboto:$PYTHONPATH

 # Add the roboto bin directory to your PATH:

   $ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/roboto/bin

 # Finally, you need to add an entry to your boto config file
   (either /etc/boto.cfg or ~/.boto) that looks like this:

   [roboto]
   json_dir = /path/to/roboto/data
